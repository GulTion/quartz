# Finite Lanauage and Theorem for Clsoure Properties
![[Pasted image 20230901125141.png]]
## Defination for Finite Lanuage
- Finite language : A language L is called a finite language if there exists a number k ∈ N, such that for every string w ∈ L, |w| ≤ k. 

- (Closure properties) The class of finite languages is closed under (finite) 
	- union, 
	- intersection, 
	- concatenation, 
	- reversal, 
	- set difference and 
	- homomorphism. 
	
- Obviously, the complement and the Kleene star of any finite language contain an infinite number of strings, thus the class of finite languages is not closed under such operations.

- The class of finite languages is not closed under inverse homomorphism.
