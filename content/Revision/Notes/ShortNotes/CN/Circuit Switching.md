## **Switching Techniques-**

[ICT | Information and Communication Technology - Introduction](https://humix.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Feducom360.com%2Fhumix%2Fvideo%2FE5GIsRqAjz2)

Various switching techniques are-

1. Circuit Switching
2. Message Switching
3. Packet Switching

In this article, we will discuss about Circuit Switching.

## **Circuit Switching-**

This switching technique operates in the following three phases-

1. Establishing a circuit
2. Transferring the data
3. Disconnecting the circuit

### **1. Establishing A Circuit-**


- Circuit provides a ==dedicated path== for data to travel from one to the other end.
- Resources are reserved at intermediate switches which are used during the transmission.
- The intermediate switches are connected by the physical links.

### **2. Transferring The Data-**

After the circuit is established,

- The entire data travels over the dedicated path from one end to the other end.

### **3. Disconnecting The Circuit-**

After the data transfer is completed,

- The circuit is torn down i.e. disconnected.

## **Total Time-**

**Total time taken to transmit a message in circuit switched network** = 
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Connection set up time</mark> + <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Transmission delay</mark> + <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Propagation delay </mark>+ <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Tear down time</mark>


where-


- Transmission delay  (Td)= Message size(L) / Bandwidth(B)
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">- Propagation delay(Tp) = (Number of hops on way(X) x Distance between 2 hops)(D) / Propagation speed(V)</mark>



## **Important Notes-**

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Circuit switching is implemented at physical layer.</mark>
- Circuit switching is now outdated.
