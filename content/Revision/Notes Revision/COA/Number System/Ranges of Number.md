- The range of UnSigned form is from $(2^{n}-1)$ 
- The range of Sign-Magnitude form is from $-(2^{n-1}-1) \space to \space (2^{n-1}-1)$ 
- The range of one's complement is from $-(2^{n-1}-1) \space to \space (2^{n-1}-1)$ 
- The range of two's complement form is from $-(2^{n-1}) \space to \space (2^{n-1}-1)$
