#note
- **n's complement of number X**
	1. convert X into n system called as Y
	2. make complement of Y with respect to (n-1) called as Z
		e.g Y=123 , n=6, so n-1=5
		  555
		-123
		-----
		432 = Z
	3. add 1 in Z then u will get **n's complement**

-  **self complementry**
	- rule: ==add all value of MSB to LSB==
		- e.g.: 8421 BCD code = 8+4+2+1 = 15
		  this is not equal to 9 so not self complement
	- **SUM MUST BE EQUAL TO 9**
