### **How to find the Mode of the Binomial Distribution?**

Let X be a Binomial variate with parameters n and p.

#### **Case 1**: When (n+1)p is an integer

Let (n + 1) p = k (an integer).  
In this case, the distribution is bi-modal, the two modal values being X=k and X=k–1.

**_Example_**: Suppose n = 9 and p = 0·4, then (n + 1) p = 10 × 0·4 = 4, which is an integer.

Hence, in this case, the distribution is bi-modal, the two modal values being 4 and 4 – 1 = 3.

#### **Case 2**: When (n+1)p is not an integer

Let (n + 1)p = k + f, where k is the integral part and f is the fractional part of (n + 1)p. In this case, the distribution has a unique mode at X = k, the integral part of (n + 1) p.

**_Example_**: If n = 7 and p = 0·6, then (n + 1) p = 8 × 0·6 = 4·8.

Hence the distribution is unimodal and Mode = 4, the integral part of 4·8.
