# Hinduism

- **Goal**: Spiritual Liberation (Moksha) is the ultimate and unlimited goal in Hinduism.

# Concept of Moksha
## Karma

- Karma is the concept that your actions have consequences.
- "What goes around, comes around" - Good actions lead to positive outcomes, and bad actions lead to negative outcomes in this life or future lives.

## Soul

- The soul in Hinduism is an eternal, indivisible essence within each living being.
- It has no size, age, or physical location.
- It is considered a part of the divine (Brahman) and is believed to be unchanging and eternal, residing within the physical body but not bound by it.

## Re-Birth

- Rebirth is the belief that after death, the soul is born again in a new body.
- The type of body or species one is reborn into is determined by the karma, or the actions from past lives.
- Good actions lead to a better life, possibly as a human, while bad actions lead to a less favorable life, possibly as an animal or insect.
- The goal is to accumulate good karma to break the cycle and achieve liberation (Moksha).

## Gunas
"guna" refers to the three fundamental qualities or attributes that are believed to shape a person's character, behavior, and disposition.
It's believed that individuals are a mixture of these gunas, with one guna usually being more dominant than the others. The balance of these gunas in a person's character influences their behavior, mindset, and actions.

| |**Sattva**|**Rajas**|**Tamas**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Description**|Represents purity, goodness, and harmony|Signifies activity, desire, and restlessness|Represents darkness, ignorance, and inertia|
|**Spiritual Impact**|Conducive to spiritual growth|Can create attachment and bondage|Considered an obstacle to spiritual progress|
|**Qualities**|Wisdom, compassion, peacefulness|Ambition, passion, attachment to desires|Laziness, delusion, confusion|

## Moksha

- The path to Moksha involves transcending the influence of the lower gunas, particularly rajas and tamas, and cultivating sattva.
- It requires purifying the mind and heart, and reducing desires and attachments.
- Ultimately, achieving Moksha is associated with transcending all the gunas and realizing the true nature of the self (Atman) as one with the ultimate reality (Brahman).
